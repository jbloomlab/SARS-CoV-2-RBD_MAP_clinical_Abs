# Plot neutralization curves

The input data are in [./data/](data).
These are plate reader data processed to give the fraction infectivity at each concentration, taken from Amin's BloomLab computational notebooks.
Each file is named by the date of the assay.

The Python Jupyter notebook [analyze_neuts.ipynb](analyze_neuts.ipynb) plot these neut data.

# Plot pseudovirus titers

The input data are in [./titer_data/](titer_data). This file contains the normalized RLU/ÂµL of pseudovirus for each of the constructs.

The R Markdown file [pseudovirus_titer.Rmd](pseudovirus_titer.RmD) plots these titer data.
