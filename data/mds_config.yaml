# Specify configuration of multi-dimensional scaling plots
#
# Each entry should be a key with the name of the plot. It then can
# have the following nested keys:
#   conditions -> antibodies / sera and names to use when plotting
#   color_scheme -> color points on mds plot by this site-level color
#                   scheme in `site_color_schemes` or color for all points.
#   plot_size -> size of plot if you want to change from default; it's a
#                square this many inches per side)
#   random_state -> multidimensional scaling is stochastic, so runs with
#                   different random number seeds will give slightly different
#                   layouts. Try different seeds here if you want to tweak
#                   appearance from default.
#   pie_size -> size of the "pies" representing the antibodies / sera,
#               bigger means larger. 
#   pie_alpha -> transparency of the pies, smaller means more transparent.
#   expand_points -> how much to repel text labels from points in plot;
#                    larger values push text further from points, see
#                    argument of same name here
#                    https://adjusttext.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
#   default_circle_color -> default color for circles around pies; use
#                           'none' for no circle.
#   circle_colors -> to color circles around pies for specific conditions,
#                    give condition name followed by color.
#   default_label_color -> like `default_circle_color` but for text labels.
#   label_colors -> like `circl_colors` but for text labels.
