# Information about outputting B-factor re-assigned PDBs and dms-view inputs
#
# Top-level keys are antibodies/ligands for which we want to annotate structural contacts
# Under each antibody key, specify:
#  pdbfile -> path to file containing PDB
#  chains_RBD -> chain(s) of RBDs in structure
#  chains_ligand -> chain(s) of ligands (Ab, ACE2)
#  distance_cutoff -> for annotating structural contacts, distance cutoff
#                     (typically 4 Angstrom for high-res with resolved side chains, 8
#                     Angstrom for low res cryo-EM with only backbone atoms)
